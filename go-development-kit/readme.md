# Project Name

## Docker Setup

We use Docker to simplify the development process. The Dockerfile sets up the environment needed for the Go project.

### Dockerfile Overview

Here's a brief overview of our Dockerfile:

\```dockerfile
# Start from the latest Golang base image
FROM golang:1.18

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Set the GOPATH
ENV GOPATH /app

# Copy everything from the current directory to the PWD(Present Working Directory) inside the container
COPY . .

# Download all the dependencies
RUN go get -d -v ./...

# Install the package
RUN go install -v ./...

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the executable
CMD ["app"]
\```

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the project directory and run:

\```bash
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
\```

### Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, use:

\```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d <your-image-name>
\```

This will start the Go application and expose it on port 8080.
